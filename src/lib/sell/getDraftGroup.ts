// T073 — Resume detection for the Sell walkthrough.
// Spec:   planning/now/scenario-F036-member-creates-business-group-via-sell-walkthrough.md
// Ticket: development/tickets/T073-sell-walkthrough-and-you-sell-cta.md
//
// Pure helper: given a Supabase client + a Member id, returns the routing
// signal the /you Sell CTA needs to pick a label + destination:
//
//   - draftGroup        — caller's in-flight kind='business' draft (resume)
//   - hasActiveBusinessGroup — caller already founded ≥1 active Shop (skip walkthrough)
//   - neither           — first-time Seller (fresh walkthrough)
//
// Three CTA branches per T073 acceptance criteria:
//   1) neither               → "Sell"                       → opens walkthrough at step 1
//   2) draftGroup            → "Continue setting up your shop" → walkthrough w/ resumeFromStep + hydrated state
//   3) hasActiveBusinessGroup → "Sell"                       → /you/sell index stub
//
// The helper is intentionally Supabase-client-shaped (not pg-shaped) so it
// can run from either a server component (createServerClient) or a client
// component (createBrowserClient). RLS does the auth filtering — we still
// pass memberId so the query is explicit about whose drafts it wants.
