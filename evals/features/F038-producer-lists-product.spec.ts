// F038: A producer lists a product
// Source: planning/now/scenario-F038-producer-lists-product.md
//
// Strategy mirrors F035 (seed read-side state once, verify the public surfaces
// beat-by-beat) plus one authed reachability beat for the "/you/sell" entry.
//
// Coverage note — two acceptance beats are verified off this surface:
//   - "Composer writes Item + child + Location in one transaction" is verified
//     at the handler layer by T077's vitest suite (the build sandbox can't reach
//     a live DB from vitest). This eval proves the READ join end-to-end: a single
//     seeded Item surfaces its items row (title), item_products child (price),
//     and item_locations pickup (label) together — the read contract the
//     transaction must satisfy. Driving the multi-step composer UI is deferred
//     (the b1 pickup picker renders from a stubbed location set — fragile to
//     drive blind); the reachability beat asserts the entry affordance exists.
//   - "Product appears in locality feed" depends on the F030 awareness feed,
//     not yet wired to this surface — out of scope for this spec.
