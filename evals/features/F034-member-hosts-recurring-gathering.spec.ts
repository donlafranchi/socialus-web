// F034: A member hosts a recurring gathering at a venue
// Source: planning/now/scenario-F034-member-hosts-recurring-gathering.md
//
// Strategy mirrors F038/F040 (seed read-side state once, verify the public
// surfaces beat-by-beat) plus one authed reachability beat for the "/you/sell"
// "Host a gathering" entry.
//
// Coverage note — beats verified off this surface:
//   - "Recurring gathering writes Item + child + events in one transaction" and
//     "composer asks 'what kind' in user language" are verified at the handler /
//     component layer by T080/T084's vitest suites (the build sandbox can't reach
//     a live DB from vitest). This eval proves the READ join end-to-end: a seeded
//     gathering surfaces its items row (title), item_gatherings child
//     (recurrence → "Every Thursday", cost), item_locations venue, and the
//     Share-link together — the read contract the transaction must satisfy.
//   - "Item appears on venue page + locality feed" depends on surfaces not wired
//     here (venue "What's happening" + F030 feed) — out of scope for this spec.
