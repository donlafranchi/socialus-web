// One test per Given/When/Then acceptance beat. The Shop is a read-only surface,
// so most beats are pure navigation + render assertions. Two beats carry
// forward-deps the scenario itself flags as deferrable:
//   - Beat 2 ("Claimed local owner" badge) — needs member_business_jurisdictions
//     + zip_is_proximal_to_location() (F037 / S-jurisdictions, not yet shipped).
//     Only the NEGATIVE branch (badge absent) is testable now.
//   - Beat 4 (follow persistence) — member_follows is member→member only; the
//     group-follow write is assigned to F042. The CTA affordance + copy is
//     testable now; the persisted follow is not.
