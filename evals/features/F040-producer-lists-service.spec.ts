// F040: A producer lists a service
// Source: planning/now/scenario-F040-producer-lists-service.md
//
// Strategy mirrors F038 (seed read-side state once, verify the public surfaces
// beat-by-beat) plus one authed reachability beat for the "/you/sell" entry.
//
// Coverage note — two acceptance beats are verified off this surface:
//   - "Composer writes Item + child in one transaction" is verified at the
//     handler layer by T081's vitest suite (the build sandbox can't reach a
//     live DB from vitest). This eval proves the READ join end-to-end: a single
//     seeded service Item surfaces its items row (title), item_services child
//     (rate_model / rate_cents → formatted rate), service_area_geography
//     (→ the service-area section), and brand resolve-up together — the read
//     contract the transaction must satisfy. Driving the multi-step composer UI
//     is deferred (mirrors F038); the reachability beat asserts the entry exists.
//   - "Service appears in locality feed" depends on the F030 awareness feed,
//     not yet wired to this surface — out of scope for this spec.
